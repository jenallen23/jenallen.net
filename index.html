    <h2>Jen Allen <span class="credentials">(ACMA, CGMA)</span></h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m Jen! I’m a Chartered Management Accountant with over five years of global experience in IT audits, privacy, and risk assurance. I enjoy combining technical expertise with strategic thinking to help businesses navigate challenges and deliver practical, compliance-driven solutions.
    <p>
        I’m passionate about privacy and risk, finding purpose in helping organisations protect sensitive data, mitigate complex risks, and build resilience in an ever-evolving digital world. My work allows me to bridge technical detail with broader strategic goals, ensuring compliance while creating trust and transparency.  
    </p>
        At the same time, I’m deeply intrigued by how AI is transforming the world—its potential to improve decision making, address emerging risks, and reshape how businesses approach complex challenges. I believe in leveraging these technologies responsibly to strike a balance between innovation and ethical data use.
    
    <p>
        Outside of work, I love running, triathlons, and free diving—activities that connect me with nature and the communities around me. These passions have also inspired me to build groups for cold-water swimming in Cape Town and running in London, bringing people together to share experiences and foster collaboration.
    
    <p>
        Building connections is what I enjoy most, so please reach out!
